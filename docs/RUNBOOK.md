# Production Runbook

Operational checklist for deploying Core Dispatch in production.

## Pre-deployment

- [ ] Set all secrets in environment
  - VAPI_API_KEY
  - WEBHOOK_SECRET
  - CALENDAR_API_KEY
  - NOTIFIER_URL
- [ ] Confirm calling window (call_window_start, call_window_end)
- [ ] Set max_attempts to a safe limit (recommend: 3)
- [ ] Enable dry_run=True for first 24h and verify logs

## Holiday guard

Add skip-days to prevent calls on public holidays:

    config = DispatchConfig(
        skip_days=['2026-07-04', '2026-12-25', '2026-01-01'],
        call_window_start=9,
        call_window_end=17,
    )

## Monitoring

- Watch dispatch.callback_queue.depth - if it grows, increase worker threads
- Alert on dispatch.lead.closed_lost_rate > 30% (signals bad lead quality)
- Alert on dispatch.webhook.hmac_fail > 0 (signals replay attack)

## Rollback

1. Stop dispatcher service
2. Export LeadStore snapshot
3. Redeploy previous version
4. Replay pending leads from snapshot

## Incident response

If leads stop advancing state:
1. Check voice provider uptime
2. Verify calling window has not expired
3. Check max_attempts has not been hit fleet-wide
4. Inspect last 10 webhook events for error patterns
